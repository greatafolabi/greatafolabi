### 🌟 My Vision

As a chemical engineering student, I believe the future belongs to engineers who can:
1. **Understand** complex systems deeply
2. **Build** the technology to optimize them
3. **Bridge** traditional engineering with modern software

I'm documenting my entire learning journey publicly—learning in public, building in public, growing in public.

### 💭 Philosophy

```python
def my_approach():
    engineering = "Domain Expertise"
    technology = "Software Skills"
    result = f"{engineering} + {technology} = Innovation"
    
    print(f"🚀 {result}")
    return result

# Output: 🚀 Domain Expertise + Software Skills = Innovation
```
